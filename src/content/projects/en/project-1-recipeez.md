My first Spring API built on a kubernetes cluster.
This is still work in progress.
I built the infrastructure with the Hetzner cloud provider.
With kubernetes I built a monitoring stack based on grafana tools
and a load balancer service for the main API. I used the Hetzner
cloud controller manager to integrate Hetzner resource into the cluster.
