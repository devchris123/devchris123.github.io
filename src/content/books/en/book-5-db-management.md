This is more of a text book as you might encounter it in university. It's all about
databases and database applications. This is a really nice book to strengthen your
understanding of data modeling and its place in software development.
It's also a nice book to look up data modeling vocabulary.

This really helped me to shift my focus on data modeling at a time where I thought
the application code should handle most of the 'business logic'.
Sometimes the most important aspect of an application is in fact its database,
its various relationships and data integrity. Once an application does more than CRUD,
e.g. processes and business objects, that have a lifecycle of their own
before going back to the persistence layer, then it might be
benefical to think about the various objects outside of the database and focus more on
how they behave in the context of the business. Remember to keep it simple.

The book also goes into phyical database design and what of it is important to the designer.
I haven't read the parts about big data and data warehousing, but the book also goes into that.
