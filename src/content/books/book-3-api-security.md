After I developed Web APIs for a while I started noticing my lack of knowledge and intuition for web security.
This book gives you a good starting point for Authentication and Authorization techniques and related security
considerations. It introduces everything step by step with hands on examples in Java.
I really liked this book because it made me understand things like stateful and stateless tokens,
basic vulnerabilities on the web and threat modeling and also discuess JWT in more detail.
From there you can pick a subject and study it in more detail on related websites, e.g. OWASP.
