Kubernetes is so fascinating when you learn about the things, that you can do with it.
This book is as great as its sibling on Docker. It follows the same schema:

* Intro
* Deep dive
* Hands on

A pretty good book as an introduction to kubernetes.
Again you still want to dive into the documentation for more advanced use cases.
