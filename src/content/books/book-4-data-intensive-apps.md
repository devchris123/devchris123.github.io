I haven't finish this book yet, but it still deserves its place here.
I already learned a lot about transactional databases and data warehouses,
different data encodings and backward/forward compatibility for apps
using databases e.g. in a microservice context. 
There is much more to come about distributed systems.
This book gives you a lot of relevant theoretical and practical knowledge especially 
if you work on larger (distributed) systems.
My favourite part was about the various read and write anomalies that can occur in 
write heavy applications.
