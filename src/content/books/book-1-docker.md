Probably my favourite technology and the best book I've read about it.
For every topic it gives a quick overview with the most important information,
and then a 'deep dive' into the topic together with hands on examples.
A pretty good book as an introduction to docker.

You still want to dive into the documentation for more advanced use cases though.
